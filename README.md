Small Animal 3D Prints

Rat Platform
  Easy to Clean
  Durable
  Non-toxic

Usage
  Designed to be compatible with wire cages only.
  Use with PLA only. Do not use with wood fiber PLA, or another materia like ABS as these can be toxic. Use Brown PLA you you want a wood look.
  Do not place on moving parts such as a cage door to prevent injury. Do not use PLA plus. It has harmful additives.
  
Specification
  Dimensions: 4 in width x 6 in length x 1 in height (10.16 cm x 15.24 cm x 2.54 cm)
  Max Weight: 1.5 lbs (680 grams). This may vary depending on the wire gauge used in the cage construction.  
  
Parts and Quanitities Required for Assembly
  3D Printed Parts:
  Platform, 1 qty
  
  Non-3D Printed Parts
  Machine Screws, 12-24 x 1-1/2 in (or longer), 2 qty (5.55 mm x 3.81 cm approx. or longer)
  Wingnuts, 2 qty (5.55 mm approx.)
  Washers, 1-1/2 in, 2 qty (3.81 approx or larger) 
 
Tools
  Phillips screw driver (long handle is easier)
  Box knife

Print Settings
 Resolution 0.15 mm
 Filament, 1.75 mm PLA
 Ironing turned ON
 50% infill

Alternate Print Settings
  If no Ironing feature avaliable, increase infill for strength. Increase model size slightly to ensure screws can dig into the printer threads.
  If for mice, and have you ironing feature you can decrease the infill. Note that decreasing the size will alter the wingnut and screw size.
  
Assembly
  1.) When printing is complete, scrape the rafting off the edges and corners of the top (flat side) with the box knife. This will discourage chewing.
  2.) On bottom insert screws in holes. Note that it will take a little effort to get the screws driver, but it shouldn't take too much. The idea is to keep the screw from spinning without the use of a tool so wingnuts can be installed later without issue.
  3.) Decide placment of platform. Do not place in aareas with moving parts such as doors. This may lead to injury.
  4.) Inside cage, place screws through the bars. Outside cage, place washes over screws. Add wingnuts.
  5.) Ensure wingsnuts are tight. Test platform by pressing down on it and twisting it. If it moves, readjusta nd tighten wingnuts.
  6.) Place treats on the platform and ingroduce platform to your rats.
  7.) Take lots of pictures and enjoy!

  Personal
    I believe the rat and small pet market is underserved. Awesomely enough I find such communities creative and vibrant as they are always thinking of great ways to make a toy or enrich their pet's environment. I was displeased with current platforms. Woods can be toxic and difficult to clean. Lava ledges can be ingested, and have quality issues. Plastic ledges are too small and designed for light weight hamsters. Guinea pig platforms are uncommon and too large. I hope you and your pet enjoy this platform!
